(2015-04-16)
Fixed powerHist to finally show frequencies with scaled normal curve and density curve
Fixed a bug in 'oneway'; post-hoc tests now working better
The 'regr' function now also computes the confidence interval for R^2
Renamed scaleReliability to scaleStructure and improved it to also provide
estimates assuming an ordinal level of measurement as well as hierarchical
omega in addition to total omega
Improved the way p values are reported in rMatrix
Improved dlvPlot to show both confidence intervals and standard errors

(version 0.2-2)
(2015-04-07)

Error in getData, that was introduced when it was changed to work better with getDat, corrected
Way eta^2 is computed in oneway corrected
A plot can now automatically be ordered when using meanDiff

(version 0.2-1)
(2015-03-23)

getDat added to automatically create a dataframe
Minor additions to the conversion functions
Added and implemented formatPvalue for cleaner p value formatting
Exported the case insensitive %IN%

(version 0.2-0)
(2015-02-27)

Added regr() and oneway()
Added samplingDistribution() and didacticPlot()
Added dataShape() so that e1071 is no longer needed for Skewness and Kurtosis in normalityAssessment()
Added associationMatrix()

(version 0.1-2)

getData improved to read more filetypes
Improved error message for getData and changed the way it's called when no dataframe is supplied
Added functions for test-retest reliability
Added functions for filtering datafile (for SPSS compatibility)
Added is.odd() and is.even()
convertToNumeric and massConvertToNumeric added to convert vectors to numeric vectors.
testRetestReliability() added to conveniently call both testRetestAlpha() and testRetestCES().
meanDiff.multi improved to generate a forest plot by default, with line at zero to show 'significant' deviations more clearly
dlvPlot improved to show better confidence intervals and take confidence level into account
rMatrrix now uses conf.level argument to construct confidence intervals
