* Added function to easily process LimeSurvey variable lables (processLSvarLabels)
* Added curfnfinder (from Nick Sabbe, with permission)

0.5-2 2016-12-15
* Fixed some errors in the list of exported functions
* descr function now uses the quantile function to compute the interquartile range
* Minor fix in dlvPlot (removed unknown aesthetic)
* Fix in invertItems to no longer simplify a dataframe to a vector if only one
  column is selected
* Added Coefficient H to scaleStructure
* Minor improvement in getData to enable suppressing messages
* Fix in meanDiff to better interpret measurement levels of input variables
* Added pwr.cohensdCI for 'power analyses' for Cohen's d confidence intervals

0.5-1 2016-11-09
* Minor tweaks to work with newest version of ggplot2
* No longer exporting all functions using regex but explicitly naming them now
  
0.5-0 2016-11-07
* Power function for Omega Squared was added
* diamondPlot functions were added
* Pander methods for some functions were added
* Some functions to make R more accessible for SPSS users were added (e.g. regr, oneway, examine)
* Confidence intervals implemented in Tukey and Games-Howell posthoc tests\
* Simple interfaces for generating ggplot scatterplots, Q-Q plots, boxplots, barcharts and pie charts were added
* showPearsonPower, a function to show the power of a Pearson correlation was added
* Cohen's d and Omega Squared distributions were added by converting to and from t and F
* A function to detect rare words was added

0.4-0 2015-
* processOpenSesameIAT was added, to process OpenSesame IAT datafiles

0.3-0 2015-04-16
* Fixed powerHist to finally show frequencies with scaled normal curve
  and density curve
* Fixed a bug in 'oneway'; post-hoc tests now working better
* The 'regr' function now also computes the confidence interval for R^2
* Renamed scaleReliability to scaleStructure and improved it to also provide
  estimates assuming an ordinal level of measurement as well as hierarchical
  omega in addition to total omega
* Improved the way p values are reported in rMatrix
* Improved dlvPlot to show both confidence intervals and standard errors

0.2-2 2015-04-07
* Error in getData, that was introduced when it was changed to work better with getDat, corrected

* Added and implemented formatPvalue for cleaner p value formatting
* Exported the case insensitive %IN%

0.2-0 2015-02-27
* New function associationMatrix() added, which takes a list of variables
  and generates a table with confidence intervals of their effect sizes
* New functions freq(), oneway(), and regr() added, which behave similar
  to SPSS functions to generate frequency tables, oneway anovas, and
  do simple regression analyses
* New function samplingDistribution() added, which allows quick generation
  of sampling distributions based on frequency information
* Added didacticPlot(), which builds plots that are useful for watching
  what happens when doing null hypothesis significance tests
* Added dataShape() so that e1071 is no longer needed for Skewness and Kurtosis
  in normalityAssessment()
