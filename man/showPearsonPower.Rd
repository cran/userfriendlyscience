\title{
Visualisation of the power of a Pearson correlation test
}
\description{
This fuction is useful when conducting power analyses for a Pearson correlation. It draws the sampling distribution of Pearson's \emph{r} assuming a null hypothesis value of \emph{r} and assuming a the hypothetical population value. The probability of making a Type 1 error is also illustrated.
}
\usage{
showPearsonPower(n = 100, rho = 0.3, rNull = 0,
                 distLabels = c("Null Hypothesis", "Population"),
                 rhoColor = "green", rhoFill = "green",
                 rhoAlpha = 0.1, rhoLineSize = 1,
                 rNullColor = "blue", rNullFill = "blue",
                 rNullAlpha = 0.1, rNullLineSize = 1,
                 type2Color = "red", type2Fill = "red",
                 type2Alpha = 0.1, type2LineSize = 0,
                 theme = dlvTheme(), alpha = 0.05, digits = 3)
