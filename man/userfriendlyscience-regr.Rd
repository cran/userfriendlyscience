\title{
Regression analysis wrapper that automatically provides confidence intervals
and standardized coefficients. Note that this function is meant for teaching
purposes, and therefore it's only for very basic regression analyses.
}
\description{
The regr function wraps a number of linear regression functions into
one convenient interface that provides similar output to the regression
function in SPSS.
}
\usage{
regr(formula, dat=NULL, conf.level=.95, digits=2,
     pvalueDigits = 3, coefficients=c("raw", "scaled"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{formula}{
The formula of the regression analysis, of the form y ~ x + z, where
y is the dependent variable and x1 and x2 are the predictors.
}
  \item{dat}{
If the terms in the formula aren't vectors but variable names, this should
be the dataframe where those variables are stored.
}
  \item{conf.level}{
The confidence of the confidence interval around the regression coefficients.
}
  \item{digits}{
Number of digits to round the output to.
}
  \item{pvalueDigits}{
The number of digits to show for p-values; smaller p-values will be shown as
<.001 or <.0001 etc.
}
  \item{coefficients}{
Which coefficients to show; can be "raw" to only show the raw
(unstandardized) coefficients; "scaled" to only show the scaled
(standardized) coefficients), or c("raw", "scaled') to show both.
}
}
\value{
A list of three elements:
\item{input}{List with input arguments}
\item{intermediate}{List of intermediate objects, such as the lm and
confint objects.}
\item{output}{List with two dataframes, one with the raw coefficients,
and one with the scaled coefficients.}
}
\examples{
### Do a simple regression analysis
regr(age ~ circumference, dat=Orange);

### Show more digits for the p-value
regr(Orange$age ~ Orange$circumference, pvalueDigits=18);
