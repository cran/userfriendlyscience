\title{
Determine required sample size for a given confidence interval width for Pearson's r
}
\description{
This function computes how many participants you need if you want to achieve a confidence interval of a given width. This is useful when you do a study and you are interested in how strongly two variables are associated.
}
\usage{
pwr.confIntR(r, w = 0.1, conf.level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
  \item{r}{
  The correlation you expect to find (confidence intervals for a given level of confidence get narrower as the correlation coefficient increases).
}
  \item{w}{
  The required half-width (or margin of error) of the confidence interval.
}
  \item{conf.level}{
  The level of confidence.
}
}
\value{
The required sample size, or a vector or matrix of sample sizes if multiple correlation coefficients or required (half-)widths were supplied. The row and column names specify the \code{r} and \code{w} values to which the sample size in each cell corresponds. The confidence level is set as attribute to the resulting vector or matrix.
