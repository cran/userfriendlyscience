\description{
This package contains a number of functions that serve
  two goals: first, make R more accessible to people migrating from
  SPSS by adding a number of functions that behave roughly like their
  SPSS equivalents; and second, make a number of slightly more
  advanced functions more user friendly to relatively novice users.

The package contains a variety of functions designed to make life easier. These functions are geared towards researchers in psychology.

The package implements many solutions provided by people all over the world, most from Stack Exchange (both from Cross Validated and Stack Overflow). I credit these authors in the help pages of those functions and in the Author(s) section of this page. If you wrote a function included here, and you want me to take it out, feel free to contact me of course (also, see \url{http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/319171/i-would-like-to-use-a-function-written-by-a-stack-overflow-member-in-an-r-packag}).

A number of functions in this package use code fragments that were used without explicit communicating with the author (because I've been unable to find contact details of the authors, or because I haven't gotten around to contacing them yet). The authors of these fragments are John Fox (\code{\link{car}} code in \code{\link{ggqq}}), Floo0 (\code{\link{ggqq}}), Jason Aizkalns (\code{\link{ggBoxplot}}).

\examples{
### Create simple dataset
dat <- PlantGrowth[1:20,];
### Remove third level from group factor
dat$group <- factor(dat$group);

### Examine normality
normalityAssessment(dat$weight);

### Compute mean difference and show it
meanDiff(dat$weight ~ dat$group, plot=TRUE);

### Show the t-test
didacticPlot(meanDiff(dat$weight ~ dat$group)$t,
             statistic='t',
             df1=meanDiff(dat$weight ~ dat$group)$df);

### Load data from simulated dataset testRetestSimData (which
### satisfies essential tau-equivalence).
data(testRetestSimData);

### Select some items in the first measurement
exampleData <- testRetestSimData[2:6];

### Show reliabilities
scaleStructure(dat=exampleData);

### Create a dichotomous variable
exampleData$group <- cut(exampleData$t0_item2, 2);

### Show a dlvPlot
dlvPlot(exampleData, x="group", y="t0_item1");

### show a dlvPlot with less participants, showing the confidence
### interval and standard error bars better
dlvPlot(exampleData[1:30, ], x="group", y="t0_item1");
