\title{
averagePearsonRs
}
\description{
Takes pairs of Pearson r's (correlation coefficients) and the
accompanying n's (sample sizes) and returns their average.
}
\usage{
averagePearsonRs(rs, ns, FishersZ = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{rs}{
  The correlation coefficients.
}
  \item{ns}{
  The sample sizes.
}
  \item{FishersZ}{
  Whether to compute the average through Fisher's z (only method implemented
  as of the writing of this document).
