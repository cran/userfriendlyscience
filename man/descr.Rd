descr (or descriptives)
}
\description{
This function provides a number of descriptives about your data, similar to
what SPSS's DESCRIPTIVES (often called with DESCR) does.
}
\usage{
descr(x, digits = 4, errorOnFactor = FALSE,
      include = c("central tendency", "spread", "range",
                  "distribution shape", "sample size"));
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
